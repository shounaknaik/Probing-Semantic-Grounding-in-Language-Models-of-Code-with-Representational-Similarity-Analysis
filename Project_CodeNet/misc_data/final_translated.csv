For example, sorting is the operation of ""sorting the elements of an array of integer values in ascending order,"" as shown in the figure below. Many sorting algorithms have been devised, and one of the most fundamental algorithms is bubble sort. As an example, let us sort a given array of integer values in ascending order using bubble sort. In bubble sort, the array is divided into ""sorted"" and ""unsorted"" portions at each computation step. Initially, the entire array is the unsorted portion. Starting at the beginning of the unsorted portion, we compare the elements next to each other (green elements in the figure) and exchange them so that the larger value is to the right. If two values are equal, they are not exchanged. This process is repeated until the end of the unsorted portion (white elements in the figure). Finally, the tail is added to the sorted portion (blue element in the figure) to complete the step. This step is repeated until the length of the unsorted portion is 1. When the length of the unsorted portion reaches 1, the sorting process is complete.

Therefore, the School Festival Executive Committee has decided to standardize the admission fees for the haunted houses within the school as shown in the table below, and based on this, the total number of visitors and revenue will be counted for each class. Please create a program that takes the number of visitors in the morning and afternoon for each class as input, and create a list of the total number of visitors and revenue for each class.",Aizu Gakuen High School holds a school festival every year. The most popular event is the haunted house. Each class has its own unique haunted house and many visitors have recently come from the neighborhood.

p00179,"Dr. A, a researcher at the Aizu Institute of Biology, discovered a mysterious insect on a southern island. It is long and slender like a caterpillar, but each body segment is shaped like a ball, making it look like a beaded ball strung together with thread. What was interesting was that there were many variations in the color of the body, and some of the bugs changed their body color over time. The color of the body segments of all insects seemed to be limited to red, green, or blue, but the color of the body segments changed every second, and in some cases all the segments were the same color and settled down at the end, while in other cases they kept changing color no matter how long we waited. In some cases, the color of all body segments changed to the same color and settled down, while in other cases, they waited until the end of the day and continued to change color. Once the body segments change color, they continue to change color until all the body segments are the same color again. Dr. A caught a number of these insects and excited them, and observed the color change with great interest. Only one pair of two adjacent body segments of different colors changes color; the color of the other segments does not change. However, when there are multiple such pairs, it is not possible to predict in advance which pair will change color. Such a pair changes to a color that is not either of the colors of the two body segments at the same time (e.g., when green and red body segments are next to each other, they change to blue at the same time). The figure above describes all the color changes of the insect up to 2 seconds later. Suppose there is an insect whose color is as shown in the upper part of the figure. If the two adjacent body segments change to one of the three colors depicted in the middle row after 1 second, all the segments can turn green after 2 seconds (second from the left in the bottom row of the figure). In contrast, when it changes after 1 second as in the first right in the middle row, all body segments cannot change to the same color after 2 seconds.

The space coconut crab is the largest crustacean in the universe and is said to grow to over 400 meters in length with its legs spread out to over 1,000 meters. Many people have already seen space crabs, but none have succeeded in catching them. Ken's long-term research has uncovered important facts about the ecology of the space coconut crab. Surprisingly, the space cocoon crab lives by moving back and forth between normal space and hyperspace, using what is equivalent to the latest warp technology called phase-transition navigation. He also discovered that it takes a long time for the space cocoon crab to warp out of hyperspace into normal space, and that it cannot move into hyperspace for a while after warping out. Ken finally decided to capture the space coconut crab. The strategy was as follows. First, he observes the energy of the space cocoon crab as it enters hyperspace from normal space. When this energy is denoted as e, the coordinates (x, y, z) at which the space cocoon crab warps out of hyperspace are known to satisfy the following conditions. x, y, z are all non-negative integers. x + y2 + z3 = e. Under the above conditions, the value of x + y + z is minimized. Although these conditions alone do not necessarily determine the coordinates uniquely, when the minimum value of x + y + z is m, it is certain that the coordinates to warp out lie on the plane x + y + z = m. Therefore, a barrier of sufficient size is placed on this plane. Then, the space coconut crab will warp out to the place where the barrier is placed. The space coconut crab affected by the barrier will be unable to move. The plan is to capture the space coconut crab by Weapon Breaker, a state-of-the-art spaceship operated by Ken. The barrier can only be put up once, so it cannot fail. Ken has decided to use the help of his calculator to accomplish his mission.

p04047,"snuke is having a barbeque party. at the party, he will make n servings of skewer meal. example of a serving of skewer meal he has a stock of 2n skewers, all of which will be used in skewer meal. the length of the i-th skewer is l_i. also, he has an infinite supply of ingredients. to make a serving of skewer meal, he picks 2 skewers and threads ingredients onto those skewers. let the length of the shorter skewer be x, then the serving can hold the maximum of x ingredients. what is the maximum total number of ingredients that his n servings of skewer meal can hold, if he uses the skewers optimally?",Snuke is having a barbeque party.

p04048,"snuke is conducting an optical experiment using mirrors and his new invention, the rifle of mysterious light. three mirrors of length n are set so that they form an equilateral triangle. let the vertices of the triangle be a, b and c. inside the triangle, the rifle is placed at the point p on segment ab such that ap = x. (the size of the rifle is negligible.) now, the rifle is about to fire a ray of mysterious light in the direction of bc. the ray of mysterious light will travel in a straight line, and will be reflected by mirrors, in the same ways as ""ordinary"" light. there is one major difference, though: it will be also reflected by its own trajectory as if it is a mirror! when the ray comes back to the rifle, the ray will be absorbed. the following image shows the ray's trajectory where n = 5 and x = 2. it can be shown that the ray eventually comes back to the rifle and is absorbed, regardless of the values of n and x. find the total length of the ray's trajectory.","Snuke is conducting an optical experiment using mirrors and his new invention, the rifle of mysterious light.
