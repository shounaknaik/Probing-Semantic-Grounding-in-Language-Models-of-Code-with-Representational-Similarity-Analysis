write a program which computes the area of a shape represented by the following three lines:

$y = x^2$
$y = 0$
$x = 600$

-->
 
it is clear that the area is $72000000$, if you use an integral you learn in high school. on the other hand, we can obtain an approximative area of the shape by adding up areas of many rectangles in the shape as shown in the following figure:
 
the approximative area $s$ where the width of the rectangles is $d$ is:

area of rectangle where its width is $d$ and height is $f(d)$ $+$ 
area of rectangle where its width is $d$ and height is $f(2d)$ $+$ 
area of rectangle where its width is $d$ and height is $f(3d)$ $+$ 
...
area of rectangle where its width is $d$ and height is $f(600 - d)$  
 
the more we decrease $d$, the higer-precision value which is close to $72000000$ we could obtain. your program should read the integer $d$ which is a divisor of $600$, and print the area $s$.

A container is divided into two halves as shown in the figure: 10 balls numbered from 1 to 10 are dropped through the opening a of the container, and the balls are placed either in the left cylinder b or in the right cylinder c. The plate d can rotate left or right around the fulcrum e, so that by moving the plate d, one can decide whether to place the balls in cylinder b or c. Since plate d can rotate left or right around fulcrum e, the ball can be placed in either tube b or tube c by moving plate d.
 
The sequence of balls to be dropped through aperture a is given. The balls are placed into tube b or c in sequence. The program should output ""yes"" if both cylinder b and c can place the larger ball on top of the smaller numbered ball, and ""no"" if they cannot. However, the order of the balls in the containers must not be interchanged. Also, it is assumed that the balls can be continuously placed in the same cylinder, and that there is enough room in both cylinders b and c for all 10 balls.

Counting was a difficult task in ancient Rome. The Arabic numerals 0,1,2,3,..., 9 were not yet in vogue. Instead, the following symbols were used.
 
i for 1, v for 5, x for 10, l for 50, c for 100, d for 500, m for 1000, and see the table above for other examples. When a smaller number follows a larger number, i.e., to the right, it adds up. When the smaller number precedes the larger number, i.e., is to the left, subtract the smaller number from the larger number. There is only one small number per subtraction that precedes the larger number and represents subtraction.

  例えば $s = \{3,4,1,5,9,2,6,5,3\}$ ならば $c = {2,1,1,2,1,1,1,2,2}$ となります。さらにこの数列 $c$ に出現頻度操作を行うと $p = \{4,5,5,4,5,5,5,4,4\}$ を得ます。この数列は出現頻度操作で変わることがありません。このような数列 $p$ を数列 $s$ の不動点と呼びます。どのような数列に対しても出現頻度操作を繰り返せば、その不動点を求めることが出来るということが知られています。
 
 下の例は出現頻度操作の手順を示したものです。1 行目を数列 $s$ 、2 行目を数列 $c$、最終行を数列 $p$ とします。数列 $s$ の最初の要素($s_1 = 2$) と同じ数は 3 個あるので数列 $c$ の最初の要素 $c_1$ は 3、次の要素 ($s_2 = 7$) と同じ数は 2 個あるので $c_2 = 2$、といった具合に個数を数え $c_i$ を求めていきます。
 
 数列の長さ $n$ と数列 $s$ を入力し、不動点の数列 $p$ および、$p$ を得るために実行した出現頻度操作の最小の回数を出力するプログラムを作成してください。

これまでに何度も戦っている二人ですが、次郎君は兄の一郎君にどうしても勝つことができません。それもそのはず、一郎君はこのゲームの必勝法を知っているからです。一郎君は、残りのおはじきの数を n とすると、必ず (n - 1) % 5 個のおはじきを取ります。ここで x % y は、x  を y  で割った余りを示します。
 
一方、次郎君は、残りのおはじきの数にかかわらず、ゲームのはじめに各回で取るおはじきの数を数列として決めてしまうのです。例えば、次郎君が決めた数列が{ 3, 1, 4, 2 } であるならば、彼の取るおはじきの数は順に 3 -> 1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1 -> 4 -> … となります（取ると決めた数が、おはじきの残りの数以上になった場合は、残りのおはじき全てを取ります）。

データを並べ替えるための整列（ソート）アルゴリズムはコンピュータ科学には欠かせない基本的なアルゴリズムです。例えば、下図のように「整数値の配列の要素を昇順に並べ替える」という操作が整列です。
 
多くの整列アルゴリズムが考案されてきましたが、その中でも基本的なアルゴリズムの１つがバブルソートです。例として、与えられた整数値の配列をバブルソートで昇順に並べてみます。
 
バブルソートでは、各計算ステップにおいて、配列を「ソートされた部分」と「ソートされていない部分」に分けて考えます。最初は配列全体がソートされていない部分になります。
 
ソートされていない部分の先頭から、隣同士の要素を比較して（図では緑色の要素）、大きい値が右にくるようにそれらを交換します。二つの値が等しい場合は交換しません。
 
この処理をソートされていない部分（図では白色の要素）の末尾まで繰り返します。最後に、末尾をソートされている部分（図では青色の要素）に追加して1ステップが完了します。
 
このステップをソートされていない部分の長さが1になるまで繰り返します。
 
このようにソートされていない部分の長さが 1 になったら、ソートの処理を終了します。
 
それでは、n 個の数値の配列を入力とし、数値が配列の先頭から昇順に並ぶように上記のバブルソートの手順で並べ替えを行い、要した配列要素の交換回数を出力するプログラムを作成してください。

調べていくうちに、ふだんはすべての体節が同じ色をしているのですが、何かに驚いたりして興奮した後は体節の色が勝手に変わってしまうことがわかりました。一度体節の色が変わってしまうと、ふたたびすべての体節が同じ色になるまではずっと色が変わり続けることがわかりました。
 
 a博士はこの虫を何匹も捕まえて興奮させてみては、色が変わる様子を興味深く観察していましたが、やがて色が変化している最中の色の変わり方には次のような規則性があることに気がつきました。
 色が変わるのは、隣り合っている色違いの 2つの体節のペア 1組だけが変わり、他の体節の色は変わらない。ただし、そのようなペアが複数あるときに、どのペアの色が変わるかはあらかじめ予測できない。 そのようなペアは、2つの体節の色のどちらでもない色に同時に変わる(たとえば、緑と赤の体節が隣り合っているときは、それらが同時に青に変わる)。 
 虫の色の変化を、2秒後まですべて書いたものが上の図です。図の上段のような色をした虫がいるとします。このとき、隣り合った色違いの体節のペアは 3組あるので、1秒後には中段に並べて描いた 3通りの色のどれかに変わります。1秒後に中段左側の 2つのように変わったときには、2秒後にすべての体節が緑色になることができます(図の下段の左側から 2番目)。 それに対して、1秒後に中段の1番右のように変わったときには、2秒後にすべての体節が同じ色に変わることはありません。
 
 博士は、目の前にいる虫の体節がすべて同じ色になる可能性があるのか、あるとしたらそうなるのは最短で何秒後なのかを予測することにしました。
 
目の前にいる虫の体節の色の並びを入力とし、その虫の体節がすべて同じ色になるのに要する最短の時間を秒単位で出力するプログラムを作成してください。ただし、同じ色になる可能性がないときは「na(半角英大文字)」と出力してください。また、虫の体節の色の並びは2  以上 10 以下のr(赤)、g(緑)、b(青)からなる文字列で表されます。

  出題者と回答者に分かれて行う。  出題者は、重複した数を含まない 4 桁の数字(正解)を決める。  回答者は、その 4 桁の数字(回答)を言い当てる。  回答に対して、出題者はヒットとブローの数でヒントを与える。  回答と正解を比べて、数と桁位置の両方が同じであることをヒットと呼び、数だけが同じで桁位置が異なることをブローと呼ぶ。たとえば、正解が 1234 で、回答が 1354 なら、出題者は「2 ヒット、1 ブロー」というヒントを与え、正解までこれを繰り返す。  出題者と回答者は交代してゲームを行い、より少ない回答で正解を言い当てた方を勝ちとする。 
太郎君と花子さんは、ヒットの数とブローの数をその都度判断することが少し面倒に感じているようです。そんな二人のために、ヒットの数とブローの数が即座に分かるプログラムを作成してあげましょう。
 
  正解 r と回答 a を入力とし、ヒットの数とブローの数を出力するプログラムを作成してください。r、a はそれぞれ 0 から 9 の数字 4 つからなる数字の列です。

  we make a tower by stacking up blocks. the tower consists of several stages and each stage is constructed by connecting blocks horizontally. each block is of the same weight and is tough enough to withstand the weight equivalent to up to $k$ blocks without crushing.
 
  we have to build the tower abiding by the following conditions:
 every stage of the tower has one or more blocks on it. each block is loaded with weight that falls within the withstanding range of the block. the weight loaded on a block in a stage is evaluated by: total weight of all blocks above the stage divided by the number of blocks within the stage. 
  given the number of blocks and the strength, make a program to evaluate the maximum height (i.e., stages) of the tower than can be constructed.

the international clown and pierrot competition (icpc), is one of the
most distinguished and also the most popular events on earth in the
show business.
 
one of the unique features of this contest is the great number of
judges that sometimes counts up to one hundred.  the number of judges
may differ from one contestant to another, because judges with any
relationship whatsoever with a specific contestant are temporarily
excluded for scoring his/her performance.
 
basically, scores given to a contestant's performance by the judges
are averaged to decide his/her score.  to avoid letting judges with
eccentric viewpoints too much influence the score, the highest and the
lowest scores are set aside in this calculation.  if the same highest
score is marked by two or more judges, only one of them is ignored.
the same is with the lowest score.  the average, which may contain
fractions, are truncated down to obtain final score as an integer.
 
you are asked to write a program that computes the scores of
performances, given the scores of all the judges, to speed up the event
to be suited for a tv program.

one of the oddest traditions of the town of gameston may be that even
the town mayor of the next term is chosen according to the result of a game.
when the expiration of the term of the mayor approaches, at least
three candidates, including the mayor of the time, play a game of
pebbles, and the winner will be the next mayor.
 
the rule of the game of pebbles is as follows.
in what follows, n is the number of participating candidates.
 


requisites
a round table, a bowl, and plenty of pebbles.
start of the game


a number of pebbles are put into the bowl;
the number is decided by the administration commission using
some secret stochastic process.
all the candidates, numbered from 0 to n-1 sit around the round table, 
in a counterclockwise order.  initially, the bowl is handed to the 
serving mayor at the time, who is numbered 0.
game steps

when a candidate is handed the bowl and if any pebbles are in it,
one pebble is taken out of the bowl and is
kept, together with those already at hand, if any.
if no pebbles are left in the bowl, the candidate puts
all the kept pebbles, if any, into the bowl.  then, in either case, the bowl is
handed to the next candidate to the right.

this step is repeated until the winner is decided.
end of the game

when a candidate takes the last pebble in the bowl, and no other
candidates keep any pebbles, the game ends and that candidate with all
the pebbles is the winner.

 
a math teacher of gameston high, through his analysis, concluded that this game will always end within a finite number of steps, although the number of required steps can be very large.

the king of a little kingdom on a little island in the pacific ocean frequently has childish
ideas. one day he said, “you shall make use of a message relaying game when you inform me
of something.” in response to the king’s statement, six servants were selected as messengers
whose names were mr. j, miss c, mr. e, mr. a, dr. p, and mr. m. they had to relay a message
to the next messenger until the message got to the king.
 
messages addressed to the king consist of digits (‘0’-‘9’) and alphabet characters (‘a’-‘z’, ‘a’-‘z’). capital and small letters are distinguished in messages. for example, “ke3e9aa” is a
message.
 
contrary to king’s expectations, he always received wrong messages, because each messenger
changed messages a bit before passing them to the next messenger. since it irritated the king, he
told you who are the minister of the science and technology agency of the kingdom, “we don’t
want such a wrong message any more. you shall develop software to correct it!” in response to
the king’s new statement, you analyzed the messengers’ mistakes with all technologies in the
kingdom, and acquired the following features of mistakes of each messenger. a surprising point
was that each messenger made the same mistake whenever relaying a message. the following
facts were observed.
 
mr. j rotates all characters of the message to the left by one. for example, he transforms
“ab23d” to “b23da”.
 
miss c rotates all characters of the message to the right by one. for example, she transforms
“ab23d” to “dab23”.
 
mr. e swaps the left half of the message with the right half. if the message has an odd number
of characters, the middle one does not move. for example, he transforms “e3ac” to “ace3”,
and “ab23d” to “3d2ab”.
 
mr. a reverses the message. for example, he transforms “ab23d” to “d32ba”.
 
dr. p increments by one all the digits in the message. if a digit is ‘9’, it becomes ‘0’. the
alphabet characters do not change. for example, he transforms “ab23d” to “ab34d”, and “e9ac”
to “e0ac”.
 
mr. m decrements by one all the digits in the message. if a digit is ‘0’, it becomes ‘9’. the
alphabet characters do not change. for example, he transforms “ab23d” to “ab12d”, and “e0ac”
to “e9ac”.

 
the software you must develop is to infer the original message from the final message, given the
order of the messengers. for example, if the order of the messengers is a -> j -> m -> p and the
message given to the king is “ab23d”, what is the original message? according to the features
of the messengers’ mistakes, the sequence leading to the final message is
 
as a result, the original message should be “32bad”.

これらの条件だけでは座標が一意に決まるとは限らないが，x + y + z の最小値を m としたときに，ワープアウトする座標が平面 x + y + z = m 上にあることは確かである．そこで，この平面上に十分な大きさのバリアを張る．すると，宇宙ヤシガニはバリアの張られたところにワープアウトすることになる．バリアの影響を受けた宇宙ヤシガニは身動きがとれなくなる．そこをケンの操作する最新鋭宇宙船であるウェポン・ブレーカー号で捕獲しようという段取りである．
 
バリアは一度しか張ることができないため，失敗するわけにはいかない．そこでケンは，任務の遂行にあたって計算機の助けを借りることにした．あなたの仕事は，宇宙ヤシガニが超空間に突入する際のエネルギーが与えられたときに，バリアを張るべき平面 x + y + z = m を求めるプログラムを書くことである．用意されたテストケースの全てに対して正しい結果を出力したとき，あなたのプログラムは受け入れられるであろう．

matsuzaki 教授は，宇宙の真理を研究している科学者である．人生，宇宙，すべての答えは 42 であると言われているが，matsuzaki 教授はこれだけでは宇宙の真理を解明するには不十分であると考えている．matsuzaki 教授は，宇宙の真理は 2 つのパラメータからなる関数で表されると考えており，42 はその 1 つに過ぎないというのである．
 
matsuzaki 教授の定義した関数 m(n, p) は，n より大きい素数を 2 つ選んで（同じ数を 2 つでも構わない）和をとることで得られる数の全体を，小さいほうから順番に並べたときに，p 番目に現れる数を表す．ここで，2 通り以上の和で表されるような数も存在するが，そういった数は和の組み合わせの数と同じ個数だけ並べられる．
 
例として n = 0 の場合を考えよう．このときは素数全体から 2 つを選んで和をとることになる．そういった和のうちで最小の数を考えると，同じ数を 2 回選ぶことも許されていることから，2 + 2 = 4 であることがわかる．すなわち m(0, 1) = 4 である．次に小さい数は 2 + 3 = 5 であるから m(0, 2) = 5 となる．同様にして考えると，和を並べたものは 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 12, 13, 14, 14, 16, ... のようになることがわかる．すなわち，たとえば m(0, 9) = 12 である．

as many of you know, we have two major calendar systems used in japan today. one of them
is gregorian calendar which is widely used across the world. it is also known as “western
calendar” in japan.
 
the other calendar system is era-based calendar, or so-called “japanese calendar.” this system
comes from ancient chinese systems. recently in japan it has been a common way to associate
dates with the emperors. in the era-based system, we represent a year with an era name given
at the time a new emperor assumes the throne. if the era name is “a”, the first regnal year
will be “a 1”, the second year will be “a 2”, and so forth.
 
since we have two different calendar systems, it is often needed to convert the date in one
calendar system to the other. in this problem, you are asked to write a program that converts
western year to era-based year, given a database that contains association between several
western years and era-based years.
 
for the simplicity, you can assume the following:
  a new era always begins on january 1st of the corresponding gregorian year.  the first year of an era is described as 1.  there is no year in which more than one era switch takes place. 
please note that, however, the database you will see may be incomplete. in other words, some
era that existed in the history may be missing from your data. so you will also have to detect
the cases where you cannot determine exactly which era the given year belongs to.

there are two standard ways to represent a graph $g = (v, e)$, where $v$ is a set of vertices and $e$ is a set of edges; adjacency list representation and adjacency matrix representation.
 
  an adjacency-list representation consists of an array $adj[|v|]$ of $|v|$ lists, one for each vertex in $v$. for each $u \in v$, the adjacency list $adj[u]$ contains all vertices $v$ such that there is an edge $(u, v) \in e$. that is, $adj[u]$ consists of all vertices adjacent to $u$ in $g$.
 
  an adjacency-matrix representation consists of $|v| \times |v|$ matrix $a = a_{ij}$ such that $a_{ij} = 1$ if $(i, j) \in e$, $a_{ij} = 0$ otherwise.

  depth-first search (dfs) follows the strategy to search ”deeper” in the graph whenever possible. in dfs, edges are recursively explored out of the most recently discovered vertex $v$ that still has unexplored edges leaving it. when all of $v$'s edges have been explored, the search ”backtracks” to explore edges leaving the vertex from which $v$ was discovered.
 
  this process continues until all the vertices that are reachable from the original source vertex have been discovered. if any undiscovered vertices remain, then one of them is selected as a new source and the search is repeated from that source.
 
  dfs timestamps each vertex as follows:
 $d[v]$ records when $v$ is first discovered. $f[v]$ records when the search finishes examining $v$’s adjacency list. 
  write a program which reads a directed graph $g = (v, e)$ and demonstrates dfs on the graph based on the following rules:
 $g$ is given in an adjacency-list. vertices are identified by ids $1, 2,... n$ respectively. ids in the adjacency list are arranged in ascending order. the program should report the discover time and the finish time for each vertex. when there are several candidates to visit during dfs, the algorithm should select the vertex with the smallest id. the timestamp starts with 1.

the bitwise xor x_1 \oplus x_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus x_n of n non-negative integers x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n is defined as follows:

- when x_1 \oplus x_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus x_n is written in base two, the digit in the 2^k's place (k \geq 0) is 1 if the number of integers among x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n whose binary representations have 1 in the 2^k's place is odd, and 0 if that count is even.

p04046,"we have a large square grid with h rows and w columns.
iroha is now standing in the top-left cell.
she will repeat going right or down to the adjacent cell, until she reaches the bottom-right cell. however, she cannot enter the cells in the intersection of the bottom a rows and the leftmost b columns. (that is, there are a×b forbidden cells.) there is no restriction on entering the other cells. find the number of ways she can travel to the bottom-right cell. since this number can be extremely large, print the number modulo 10^9+7.

p04047,"snuke is having a barbeque party. at the party, he will make n servings of skewer meal. example of a serving of skewer meal he has a stock of 2n skewers, all of which will be used in skewer meal. the length of the i-th skewer is l_i.
also, he has an infinite supply of ingredients. to make a serving of skewer meal, he picks 2 skewers and threads ingredients onto those skewers.
let the length of the shorter skewer be x, then the serving can hold the maximum of x ingredients. what is the maximum total number of ingredients that his n servings of skewer meal can hold, if he uses the skewers optimally? 
"
p04048,"snuke is conducting an optical experiment using mirrors and his new invention, the rifle of mysterious light. three mirrors of length n are set so that they form an equilateral triangle.
let the vertices of the triangle be a, b and c. inside the triangle, the rifle is placed at the point p on segment ab such that ap = x.
(the size of the rifle is negligible.)
now, the rifle is about to fire a ray of mysterious light in the direction of bc. the ray of mysterious light will travel in a straight line, and will be reflected by mirrors, in the same ways as ""ordinary"" light.
there is one major difference, though: it will be also reflected by its own trajectory as if it is a mirror!
when the ray comes back to the rifle, the ray will be absorbed. the following image shows the ray's trajectory where n = 5 and x = 2. it can be shown that the ray eventually comes back to the rifle and is absorbed, regardless of the values of n and x.
find the total length of the ray's trajectory.
